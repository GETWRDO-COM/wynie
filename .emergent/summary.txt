The AI engineer successfully transitioned the project from a Deepvue clone concept to a functional Market Workstation MVP. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with a frontend-only mock, then progressively integrating backend services and real data. Key challenges included replicating complex UI/UX elements, handling external API integrations (Polygon.io, Finnhub), implementing server-side computations for financial metrics, and managing API rate limits through caching and graceful degradation. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback on design elements like logo visibility and dropdown functionality, and adapted the scope dynamically, deferring full TradingView Charting Library integration due to external dependency. The project is currently focused on expanding the screener's capabilities and enhancing data display.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to clone Deepvue (deepvue.com) as an MVP. The scope was narrowed to a Market Workstation focusing on core functionalities: a two-pane UI with watchlists, a screener, a dense data table, and a charting area.
**Key Features Required & Implemented:**
*   **Frontend Design:** High-fidelity UI replicating Deepvue's dark theme, compact layouts, and interactive elements. This includes resizable panels, a TV-style toolbar, logo display with proper contrast, and functional Shadcn UI components (e.g., dropdowns).
*   **Market Data:** Integration with real-time and historical market data providers (Polygon.io and Finnhub).
*   **Watchlists:** CRUD operations for watchlists, adding/removing/reordering symbols, and real-time updates.
*   **Screener:** A powerful server-side screener with a query builder, multiple categories of filters (price/volume, technicals, earnings, fundamentals, proprietary ratings like RS/AS), sorting, and saved presets.
*   **Column Settings:** A comprehensive manager for table columns, allowing categories, search, visibility toggle, reordering, and saving/loading presets.
*   **Charting:** Integration with a charting library (initially a placeholder, aiming for TradingView Charting Library for advanced drawing tools).
*   **Alerts:** In-app price alerts (above/below, % change) with live notifications.
*   **API Key Management:** A frontend Settings page to update API keys dynamically, persisting to backend  files.
*   **Non-features:** Excluded login, account dashboard, welcome/product tours, support menu, education, dictionary, and mobile-specific development for now.

<current_work>
The Market Workstation MVP is functionally robust on the frontend with a dark theme and a responsive, two-pane layout.
*   **Layout**: The primary workstation displays a chart area with a TV-like toolbar (placeholder) and a compact Live List on the top row, with a full, dense data table on the bottom row. This matches the user's Deepvue screenshots.
*   **Rebranding**: All UI text has been rebranded from Deepvue to Market Workstation as per user request.
*   **Logo Visibility**: A critical UI issue with dark-on-dark logos has been resolved by rendering logos inside white circular chips with subtle rings and padding, ensuring proper contrast.
*   **Dropdowns**: All native HTML selects have been replaced with Shadcn UI  components, resolving visibility issues in dark mode and providing consistent styling for header controls, Screener Sort By, and Column Settings Load preset, and row Density controls.
*   **API Key Management**: A  route allows users to update Polygon and Finnhub API keys from the frontend, which are then persisted to the backend's  file and hot-swapped for immediate effect.
*   **Data Integration**:
    *   Polygon.io is integrated for real-time quotes (via WebSocket polling fallback) and daily bars (with caching and rate-limit handling).
    *   Finnhub is integrated for expanded fundamentals data.
*   **Screener**: The Screener panel is now embedded inline on the top-right (no longer a tab). It features presets (New Highs, Red List), a query builder with AND/OR groups, and its Run functionality updates both the Live List and the bottom data table with real backend results. Initial filters (last, changePct, volume, rsi14) are implemented.
*   **Alerts**: In-app only price alerts (above/below, % change ≥) are live, with a background checker and a notifications bell in the header that updates via live WebSocket. Quick-create alert buttons are available above the chart.
*   **Column Settings**: The column manager is functional, providing categories, search, visibility toggle, reordering, and preset management. Table density can be adjusted (Compact/Cozy/Comfortable).

<optional_next_step>
The next immediate step is to continue expanding the screener filters and server-side computations towards full Deepvue parity.
