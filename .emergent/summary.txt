The AI engineer's work in this trajectory began with debugging persistent 404 errors for the Rotation Lab feature, successfully resolving backend API route issues in  and front-end URL construction. Following this, the user requested a comprehensive review and improvement of the dashboard, leading to an extensive UI/UX overhaul. The engineer implemented new components (GlobalClock, NewsBanner, WatchlistsSection, etc.), fixed data integrations (Fear & Greed, Market Score), and refined styling, initially aiming for a world-class, Apple glass aesthetic with dynamic gradients and geolocation. This involved iterative changes to , , , , and . A drag-and-drop layout system was also prepared. However, the user eventually found the aggressive dark glass design too busy and colorful, explicitly listing multiple UI/UX issues for correction, including flag rendering, font choices, layout compaction, and the news banner functionality. The trajectory ends with the AI engineer acknowledging this feedback and commencing the revert to a cleaner design, starting with  and .

The application, HUNT by WRDO, required a full global re-skin to achieve an iconic premium wow aesthetic with a cinematic, dark UI, glass panels, neon accents, Host Grotesk font, and a Cyanâ†’Purple gradient. Core features included a responsive navigation, an enhanced dashboard Hero banner with live times/NYSE status/weather, live currency rates, a super slow-motion breaking news ticker, and existing dashboard element restoration. Market data features encompassed advanced stock charts, CNN Greed and Fear Index, My Performance for portfolio tracking, and a Market Score card. An AI chatbot (WRDO) was to be global and floating. A dedicated News section with categories and earnings announcements via Finnhub was also needed. Authentication supported login, account creation, and password management. A new Rotation Lab allowed leveraged ETF backtesting with configurable parameters, charts, KPIs, A/B comparison, presets, and CSV export. Subsequent refinements included specific design adjustments for cards (Apple glass effect, dark glass, neutral backgrounds), precise date/time formatting (SA format, HH:MM:SS AM/PM), geolocation-aware displays, holiday integration, compact weather/currency cards, a hyperlinked news banner with categories, and a Hey WRDO! AI button. The user also requested drag-and-drop card reordering/resizing, though this feature's activation was pending.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of rectifying a previously implemented dark glass design, which the user deemed too busy and colorful. The user provided a detailed list of specific UI/UX issues, indicating a preference for a cleaner, more professional, yet still premium look.

The AI engineer acknowledged this feedback and stated the intention to revert to a cleaner, more professional look and fix all the specific issues.

The last actions taken were:
1.  **Editing **: To make it more compact, clean, fix specific issues like the date/time display, reload button positioning, and card headers.
2.  **Stating the next step**: To address the Unknown location issue in the  component.

The current state is a partial rollback and refinement of the dashboard's aesthetic, moving away from an overly complex dark glass design to a more minimalist, functional, and visually appealing one, while simultaneously resolving multiple granular UI bugs. The drag-and-drop dashboard component was created and integrated into  but not yet actively deployed to the main dashboard rendering.
