The previous AI engineer was tasked with a full global reskin of an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application using a provided UI kit. The development proceeded iteratively, with frequent user feedback driving continuous refinement. The AI engineer's approach involved:
1.  **Initial Setup & UI Kit Integration**: Exploring the existing codebase, installing dependencies, then integrating the user-provided UI kit (a Figma design ZIP). This involved extracting assets, creating global theme wrappers, and applying initial styles via Tailwind CSS.
2.  **Iterative Design Refinement**: The user provided highly specific and frequent feedback (looks like shit, make it iconic premium wow), leading to multiple passes of UI polish. This included refining glassmorphism effects, neon glows, navigation bar (), typography ( font), and a custom brand gradient.
3.  **Feature Additions**: Alongside design, the engineer integrated new functionalities such as live time/date display with timezone detection, market status (NYSE holiday-aware countdown), live currency exchange, and a breaking news ticker.
4.  **Layout and Alignment**: A significant portion of the work involved meticulous adjustments to component placement, spacing, and overall page alignment, directly responding to the user's neat and aligned preference.
5.  **Bug Fixing**: Key bug addressed was the site not showing issue due to a missing  component, which was restored. Recurring issues with news ticker visibility and FX layout were also addressed multiple times.
The trajectory ends with the user requesting more advanced chart features, CNN Greed and Fear Index integration, and a persistent news ticker issue, indicating a shift towards data visualization enhancements.

<product_requirements>
The user's core requirement was to apply a full global re-skin to an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application using a provided Figma design UI kit (simplelist-design-figma.zip). The desired aesthetic was epic, iconic premium wow, featuring elements like frosted glass, subtle glows, and a clean, aligned layout.

**Implemented features include:**
*   Global UI reskin: applying a dark, cinematic theme with glass panels, neon accents, and polished components.
*   Branding: rebranding the application from ETF Intelligence Engine to HUNT by WRDO (lowercase by) across all visible areas.
*   Navigation: implementing a premium, responsive navigation bar with pill tabs, a custom brand block, and a placeholder Apple-style mega-menu.
*   Typography: integrating Host Grotesk font (Bold, Regular, Medium weights) and applying it globally.
*   Gradients: establishing a signature Cyan → Purple gradient for UI accents (buttons, active tabs).
*   Dashboard enhancements:
    *   Hero banner with frosted glass and subtle glows.
    *   Live time and date display: showing South African (Cape Town) time, USA (New York ET) time, and auto-detecting local time with flags.
    *   Market status: NYSE open/closed status with a holiday-aware countdown timer, including half-day closings.
    *   Weather widget: displaying current location, temperature (current, high/low), and chance of rain.
    *   Live currency exchange: ZAR equivalents for USD, EUR, GBP, JPY (100 ¥), CNY (1 ¥), displayed in a unified card with flags and refresh timestamp.
    *   Breaking news ticker: a super slow-motion (CNN-style) scrolling ticker with category selection and headline dividers.
    *   Restoration of existing dashboard elements: mini index charts (S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, Dow), Market Score card, Top Swing Leaders, and Watchlists grid.
*   Alignment and layout: meticulous adjustments to ensure components are neatly aligned, spaced, and visually coherent across the page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a deep refinement of the application's UI/UX and integrating complex real-time data displays, driven by highly iterative user feedback.

The most recent changes focused on:
1.  **Layout and Alignment**: The date pill (Monday, 11 August 2025) was moved to the top-right, made larger and bolder. SA and USA time clocks were moved closer together and made consistent with uppercase AM/PM. The Opens in countdown was moved next to Market Status and made bigger/bolder.
2.  **Weather and FX Layouts**: The weather widget was redesigned as a proper card, showing the resolved location name (e.g., Paarl) below the date, with current temp, H/L, and rain chance. The FX rates were completely re-laid out into a single, spacious card with vertically divided rows for each currency, including flags, codes, bold ZAR values, and an Updated HH:MM:SS timestamp, with a 15-minute auto-refresh.
3.  **News Ticker**: The breaking news ticker, which had intermittently disappeared, was restored and slowed down even further to a super slow-mo (900s per loop, 15 minutes) CNN-style crawl with visible dividers.
4.  **Dashboard Content Restoration**: Crucially, the rest of the page content (DashboardQuickSections including mini index charts, Market Score, Top Swing Leaders, Watchlists) was restored and positioned below the hero banner, addressing user concern about missing content.

The user's very last message () then introduced a new, significant set of tasks: advanced stock charts (with specific tickers, time ranges, and red/green percentages), a live CNN Greed and Fear Index, and a renewed complaint about the news ticker not showing. The engineer's last action () was reading  in the backend, indicating an immediate shift to implement the new data visualization features, likely starting with the Polygon.io API key provided.
