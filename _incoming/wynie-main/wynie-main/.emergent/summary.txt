The AI engineer, initially presented with a Google Sheets and Notion-based ETF tracking system, successfully pivoted to a more robust FastAPI and React web application. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core ETF tracking and progressively adding complex features like AI-powered chart analysis, customizable watchlists, and comprehensive market situational awareness (MSAE). A key strength was the AI's ability to interpret a dense, manual spreadsheet framework into an automated, configurable digital product. Challenges included integrating various data sources, implementing complex financial calculations, and ensuring a highly interactive and user-friendly interface with granular control over formulas. The AI demonstrated strong problem-solving by breaking down the large task, handling file size limitations, and addressing user feedback on UI/UX and functionality.
